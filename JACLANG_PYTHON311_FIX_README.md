# Jaclang Python 3.11 Compatibility Fix

## Problem Description

The `jac` command from the `jaclang` package fails on Python 3.11 with the following error:

```
ImportError: cannot import name 'override' from 'typing'
```

This occurs because the `override` decorator was only introduced in Python 3.12, but `jaclang` tries to import it directly from the `typing` module.

## Root Cause

The issue is in `jaclang/runtimelib/builtin.py` at line 7:

```python
from typing import ClassVar, Optional, override
```

This import fails on Python 3.11 because `override` doesn't exist in the standard library `typing` module until Python 3.12.

## Solutions Provided

### 1. Permanent Source Code Patch (Recommended)

**File:** `patch_jaclang.py`

This script applies a permanent fix by modifying the jaclang installation to use a compatibility import:

```bash
python patch_jaclang.py
```

**What it does:**
- Creates a backup of the original `builtin.py` file
- Replaces the problematic import with a compatibility version that tries `typing` first, then falls back to `typing_extensions`
- Tests the installation to ensure it works

**Result:** The original `jac` command works normally after applying this patch.

### 2. Runtime Wrapper (Alternative)

**File:** `jac_wrapper.py`

A wrapper script that applies the compatibility patch at runtime:

```bash
python jac_wrapper.py --version
python jac_wrapper.py [other jac commands]
```

**What it does:**
- Monkey-patches the `typing` module to add the missing `override` decorator
- Runs the jaclang CLI with the patch applied

### 3. Import-Time Compatibility Module

**File:** `jaclang_compat.py`

A module that can be imported before using jaclang in Python code:

```python
import jaclang_compat  # Import this first
import jaclang
# Now jaclang works
```

## Verification

After applying any of these solutions, you can verify that jaclang works:

```bash
# Test version
jac --version

# Test help
jac --help

# Expected output:
# Jac version 0.8.2
# Jac path: [path to jaclang installation]
```

## Dependencies

Make sure you have `typing_extensions` installed:

```bash
pip install typing_extensions
```

## Files Created

1. **`patch_jaclang.py`** - Permanent source code patcher (recommended)
2. **`jac_wrapper.py`** - Runtime wrapper script
3. **`jaclang_compat.py`** - Import-time compatibility module
4. **`JACLANG_PYTHON311_FIX_README.md`** - This documentation

## Compatibility

- **Python Version:** 3.11+
- **Jaclang Version:** 0.8.2 (and likely other versions with the same issue)
- **Platform:** Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)

## Technical Details

The `override` decorator was introduced in Python 3.12 as part of PEP 698. The `typing_extensions` package provides a backport of this decorator for earlier Python versions. Our fix ensures that jaclang uses the backported version when running on Python 3.11.

## Backup and Recovery

The permanent patch creates a backup file at:
```
[jaclang_path]/runtimelib/builtin.py.backup
```

To restore the original file if needed:
```bash
# Navigate to the jaclang installation directory
# Copy the backup back to the original location
cp builtin.py.backup builtin.py
```

## Support

This fix resolves the compatibility issue between jaclang and Python 3.11. If you encounter any issues with the patch, you can:

1. Use the wrapper script as an alternative
2. Restore from the backup file
3. Reinstall jaclang and reapply the patch
