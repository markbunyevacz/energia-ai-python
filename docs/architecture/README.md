# Architecture Guardrails

This directory contains the master documentation for the system's architecture. These documents are the official specification for the design and are considered the "source of truth."

## The Golden Rule

**All development that impacts the system's architecture MUST begin here.**

Before any implementation, the relevant architectural documents must be updated to reflect the proposed changes. This process ensures that all architectural decisions are deliberate, reviewed, and documented.
