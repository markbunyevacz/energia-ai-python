# Energia Legal AI - Python Architecture Documentation

This directory contains the architectural documentation for the Energia Legal AI Python backend system.

## 📁 Architecture Overview

The Energia Legal AI system is built with a **Python-first, microservices-oriented architecture** designed for scalability, maintainability, and performance in the legal domain.

### Core Principles

1. **Python-Native Design**: Built from the ground up in Python with FastAPI for high-performance APIs
2. **Microservices Architecture**: Loosely coupled services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently
3. **AI-First Approach**: Designed around AI agents and machine learning workflows
4. **Legal Domain Expertise**: Specialized for Hungarian legal system and energy sector regulations
5. **Security & Compliance**: Built-in security measures and audit trails for legal requirements

## 🏗️ System Architecture

## The Golden Rule

**All development that impacts the system's architecture MUST begin here.**

Before any implementation, the relevant architectural documents must be updated to reflect the proposed changes. This process ensures that all architectural decisions are deliberate, reviewed, and documented.
