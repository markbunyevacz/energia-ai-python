   - Need to update frontend to use proper Supabase function calls

2. **Real-time Features:**
   - Backend supports real-time subscriptions but frontend doesn't utilize them
   - Opportunity for live analysis progress updates

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Frontend has basic error handling but could leverage backend's sophisticated error correlation service

4. **Caching:**
   - Backend has caching capabilities but frontend doesn't implement client-side caching strategies

**Recommended Improvements:**

1. **API Layer Alignment:**
   ```typescript
   // Current frontend call
   const response = await fetch('/api/analyze', { ... });
   
   // Should be updated to
   const { data, error } = await supabase.functions.invoke('analyze-contract', {
     body: { documentId, content, userId }
   });
   ```

2. **Real-time Updates:**
   ```typescript
   // Add real-time analysis progress
   useEffect(() => {
     const subscription = supabase
       .channel('analysis-progress')
       .on('postgres_changes', {
         event: 'UPDATE',
         schema: 'public',
         table: 'contract_analyses'
       }, handleAnalysisUpdate)
       .subscribe();
   }, []);
   ```

3. **Enhanced Error Handling:**
   ```typescript
   // Integrate with backend error correlation service
   const handleError = (error: Error) => {
     errorCorrelationService.logError(error, {
       userId: user.id,
       component: 'LovableFrontend',
       action: 'document-analysis'

## Strategic Direction for Access Control and User Roles

Based on a detailed strategic review, the following blueprint has been developed to evolve the application's current Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system into a more granular, scalable, and user-centric model. This plan directly addresses the long-term requirements for multi-domain support, enterprise-grade security, and compliance outlined in the project's development principles (dp.md).

### 1. Core Role Hierarchy and Responsibilities

The foundation is a clear role hierarchy where higher roles inherit the permissions of lower ones.

-   **System Administrator:** A technical role focused on system health, user management (inviting, assigning roles), and global configuration.
-   **Legal Manager (Partner/Team Lead):** Manages teams and workstreams. Can create cases, assign documents, review/approve analyses, and manage team access to legal domains.
-   **Analyst (Lawyer/Associate):** The primary user performing core analysis work using the full suite of tools like `LovableFrontend`.
-   **Viewer (Client/Stakeholder):** A read-only role with access restricted to explicitly shared documents or analyses.

### 2. Granular, Permission-Based Architecture

To move beyond the limitations of a role-only system and support multi-domain complexity, the architecture will shift to a granular, permission-based model layered on top of the core roles.

-   **Fine-Grained Permissions:** The system will be governed by explicit permission strings (e.g., `document:upload`, `domain:view:energy_law`, `user:invite`). Roles will become default bundles of these permissions.
-   **Permission Templates with Inheritance:** To streamline administration, `Legal Managers` and `Admins` can create templates (e.g., "Junior Energy Analyst"). These templates will support inheritance (e.g., "Senior Analyst" inherits from "Junior Analyst" and adds more permissions), making the system highly maintainable.

### 3. UI/UX Implications and Best Practices

The permission system must be intuitive and enhance the user experience.

-   **Progressive Disclosure:** The UI will dynamically adapt. A `Legal Manager` will see additional UI elements like "Approve" buttons or "Team Dashboard" tabs that are invisible to an `Analyst`.
-   **Clear Visual Hierarchy:** Subtle cues like **Role Badges** ("Jane Doe - *Legal Manager*") and contextual page titles will reinforce the user's current capabilities.
-   **Permission Explanations:** To build trust, disabled elements will have tooltips explaining *why* access is restricted. Contextual help links ("Why do I need 'Corporate Law' access for this?") will provide further clarity.
-   **Audit Trail as a UX Feature:** The compliance audit log will be transformed into a user-facing "Case Timeline" or "History" feature, showing who has done what in a human-readable format, turning a compliance burden into a collaboration tool.

### 4. Advanced Access Control Patterns

The model is designed to handle complex, real-world legal scenarios gracefully.

-   **Flexible Client Access (Viewers):** Instead of creating multiple viewer roles, the system will feature a **granular sharing dialog**. An `Analyst` or `Manager` sharing a document can use checkboxes to control exactly what the `Viewer` can see (e.g., summary only, full text, comments) and set access expiration dates.
-   **Cross-Domain Collaboration:** Cases can be tagged with multiple legal domains. To access them, a user must have permissions for **all** associated domains (an "intersection model"). A "Lead Reviewer" can be assigned to a case to manage approvals while specialists collaborate within their permitted scope.
-   **External API Integration:** Third-party systems will be managed via **Service Accounts**. These are non-human users with their own API keys and granular permissions, ensuring all actions are securely managed and tracked in the audit trail.

### 5. Governance and Maintenance

The long-term integrity of the system will be ensured through clear rules and dedicated tooling.

-   **Permission Conflict Resolution:** The system will enforce a **Deny by Default / Most Restrictive Wins** policy. If a user has conflicting permissions from different assignments, the most restrictive rule will apply, ensuring the highest level of security.
-   **Domain Lifecycle Management:** A "Domain Management Console" will be created for `Admins` to manage the evolution of legal practice areas. This will allow them to create, archive, and, most importantly, manage the migration of documents and permissions when a domain splits or changes (e.g., "Energy Law" evolving into "Renewable Energy" and "Oil & Gas").

### 6. Advanced Governance and Real-World Scenarios

To ensure the model is robust enough for the complexities of legal practice, it incorporates solutions for exceptional circumstances, external communications, and regulatory demands.

-   **Emergency Access ("Break-Glass" Procedure):** For genuine emergencies (e.g., a critical court deadline), the system will feature a formal, audited **Elevated Access Request** workflow. A user can request temporary, time-bound access to a restricted resource, which must be approved by a designated authority (e.g., System Admin, Head of Compliance). The entire process—request, justification, approval, and all actions taken—is logged with high priority in the audit trail, providing a fully transparent and accountable exception mechanism.

-   **Secure Client Communication Integration:** The platform's permission model extends to external communications. Instead of insecure email attachments, documents are shared via a **secure client portal** (using the `Viewer` role) where granular access controls are enforced. Any documents exported from the system are "redaction-aware," meaning they will only contain the information the recipient is authorized to see.

-   **Domain-Specific Compliance Reporting:** To address varying regulatory requirements, the permission model supports domain-specific reporting without administrative overhead. Legal domains can be tagged with metadata (e.g., `MEKH_REPORTING_REQUIRED`). The audit trail can then be filtered by these tags, allowing a `Compliance Officer` to easily generate domain-specific reports (e.g., "Show all access events for MEKH-related documents this quarter").

This strategic access control model, complete with its advanced governance patterns, provides the security, usability, and scalability required for the platform's ambitious goal of serving all areas of Hungarian law.
