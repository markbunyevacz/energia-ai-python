- Detailed improvement recommendations

## Key Findings and Recommendations

### 1. Immediate Issues Identified

**API Integration Mismatch:**
```typescript
// Current problematic implementation
const response = await fetch('/api/analyze', { ... });

// Recommended Supabase function integration
const { data, error } = await supabase.functions.invoke('analyze-contract', {
  body: { documentId, content, userId, analysisType, notes }
});
```

**Missing Real-time Features:**
- Backend supports real-time subscriptions
- Frontend doesn't utilize live progress updates
- Opportunity for enhanced user experience

### 2. Architecture Strengths

**Modern React Patterns:**
- ✅ Functional components with hooks
- ✅ Proper state management
- ✅ Type-safe implementations
- ✅ Component composition patterns

**Security Implementation:**
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Protected routes
- ✅ Secure authentication flow
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization

**User Experience:**
- ✅ Loading states and error handling
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Accessibility features
- ✅ Hungarian localization

### 3. Performance Considerations

**Current Optimizations:**
- Modern React 18 with concurrent features
- Vite for fast development builds
- Component-based architecture
- Efficient re-rendering patterns

**Optimization Opportunities:**
- Implement React.memo for expensive components
- Add virtual scrolling for large lists
- Optimize bundle size with dynamic imports
- Implement service worker for offline capabilities

## Integration Gaps and Solutions

### 1. Frontend-Backend Alignment

**Current Gaps:**
- API endpoint mismatch (REST vs Supabase functions)
- Underutilized real-time capabilities
- Basic error handling vs sophisticated backend error correlation

**Recommended Solutions:**
- Update frontend to use Supabase edge functions
- Implement real-time progress tracking
- Integrate with backend error correlation service
- Add client-side caching strategies

### 2. Enhanced User Experience

**Immediate Improvements:**
- Fix API integration for proper functionality
- Add drag-and-drop file upload
- Implement progress indicators
- Enhance mobile responsiveness

**Medium-term Enhancements:**
- Real-time collaboration features
- Advanced document annotation tools
- Bulk processing capabilities
- Export functionality
