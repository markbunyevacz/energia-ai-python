   - Frontend expects `/api/analyze` endpoint but backend uses Supabase functions
   - Need to update frontend to use proper Supabase function calls

2. **Real-time Features:**
   - Backend supports real-time subscriptions but frontend doesn't utilize them
   - Opportunity for live analysis progress updates

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Frontend has basic error handling but could leverage backend's sophisticated error correlation service

4. **Caching:**
   - Backend has caching capabilities but frontend doesn't implement client-side caching strategies

**Recommended Improvements:**

1. **API Layer Alignment:**
   ```typescript
   // Current frontend call
   const response = await fetch('/api/analyze', { ... });
   
   // Should be updated to
   const { data, error } = await supabase.functions.invoke('analyze-contract', {
     body: { documentId, content, userId }
   });
   ```

2. **Real-time Updates:**
   ```typescript
   // Add real-time analysis progress
   useEffect(() => {
     const subscription = supabase
       .channel('analysis-progress')
       .on('postgres_changes', {
         event: 'UPDATE',
         schema: 'public',
         table: 'contract_analyses'
       }, handleAnalysisUpdate)
       .subscribe();
   }, []);
   ```

3. **Enhanced Error Handling:**
   ```typescript
   // Integrate with backend error correlation service
   const handleError = (error: Error) => {
     errorCorrelationService.logError(error, {
       userId: user.id,
       component: 'LovableFrontend',
       action: 'document-analysis'
     });
   };
   ```
